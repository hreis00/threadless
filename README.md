# Threadless

### What is Threadless?

Threadless is social media/art gallery that allows users to publish their artwork and keep in touch with their favorite artists.

### TODO:

- [ ] Implement a payment/checkout feature.
- [ ] Refine the exhibitions page, using the same method for the PostPage and PostCard (maybe add diferent textbox and allow to upload more than one image).
- [ ] Refine the search page, allowing users to search for other users/artists alongside artwork and future events.

- [ ] Implement comment model, controller and route, to allow users to comment, delete the comments and recieve notifications.
